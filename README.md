# A-Maze

https://nicoa47.github.io/A-Maze/

A claustrophobic maze game with incredible graphics.

Get out of the maze before it's too late. (Some scattered meds might help.)

Use the arrow keys or MAYBE try tilting your phone (not guaranteed to work on all devices)

And whilst at it, you might consider watching some videos where I code this game and talk about the process (in german).
